## Installation
```bash
pip install hugchat
```
or
```bash

```

## Usage

### API

The following are all common usages of this repo, You may not necessarily use all of them, You can add or delete some as needed :)

```py
from hugchat import hugchat
from hugchat.login import Login

# Log in to huggingface and grant authorization to huggingchat
sign = Login(email, passwd)
cookies = sign.login()

# Save cookies to the local directory
cookie_path_dir = "./cookies_snapshot"
sign.saveCookiesToDir(cookie_path_dir)

# Load cookies when you restart your program:
# sign = login(email, None)
# cookies = sign.loadCookiesFromDir(cookie_path_dir) # This will detect if the JSON file exists, return cookies if it does and raise an Exception if it's not.

# Create a ChatBot
chatbot = hugchat.ChatBot(cookies=cookies.get_dict())  # or cookie_path="usercookies/<email>.json"

# non stream response
query_result = chatbot.query("Hi!")
print(query_result) # or query_result.text or query_result["text"]

# stream response
for resp in chatbot.query(
    "Hello",
    stream=True
):
    print(resp)

# Use web search (new feature)
query_result = chatbot.query("Hi!", web_search=True)
print(query_result) # or query_result.text or query_result["text"]
for source in query_result.web_search_sources:
    print(source.link)
    print(source.title)
    print(source.hostname)

# Create a new conversation
id = chatbot.new_conversation()
chatbot.change_conversation(id)

# Get conversation list
conversation_list = chatbot.get_conversation_list()

# Get the available models (not hardcore)
models = chatbot.get_available_llm_models()

# Switch model to the given index
chatbot.switch_llm(0) # Switch to the first model
chatbot.switch_llm(1) # Switch to the second model

# Get information about the current conversation
info = chatbot.get_conversation_info()
print(info.id, info.title, info.model, info.system_prompt, info.history)

# Get conversations on the server that are not from the current session (all your conversations in huggingchat)
chatbot.get_remote_conversations(replace_conversation_list=True)

# [DANGER] Delete all the conversations for the logged in user
chatbot.delete_all_conversations()
```

The `query()` function receives these parameters:

- `text`: Required[str].
- `retry_count`: Optional[int]. Number of retries for requesting huggingchat. Default is 5
- `web_search` : Optional[bool]. Whether to use online search.

### CLI

> `version 0.0.5.2` or newer

Simply run the following command in your terminal to start the CLI mode

```bash
python -m hugchat.cli

- `-c` : Continue previous conversation in CLI ".

Commands in cli mode:

- `/new` : Create and switch to a new conversation.
- `/ids` : Shows a list of all ID numbers and ID strings in current session.
- `/switch` : Shows a list of all conversations' info in *current session*. Then you can choose one to switch to.
- `/switch all`: Shows a list of all conversations' info in *your account*. Then you can choose one to switch to. (not recommended if your account has a lot of conversations,)
- `/switch all <num>`: Same as above but displays the specified number of conversations.
- `/del <id>` : Deletes the ID number or ID string passed. Will not delete active session.
- `/delete-all` : Deletes all the conversations for the logged in user.
- `/clear` : Clear the terminal.
- `/llm` : Get available models you can switch to.
- `/llm <index>` : Switches model to given model index based on `/llm`.
- `/sharewithauthor <on|off>` : Changes settings for sharing data with model author. On by default.
- `/exit` : Closes CLI environment.
- `/stream <on|off>`: streaming the response.
- `/web <on|off>`: web search.
- `/web-hint <on|off>`: display web search hint.

- AI is an area of active research with known problems such as biased generation and misinformation. Do not use this application for high-stakes decisions or advice.
- Server resources are precious, it is not recommended to request this API in a high frequency.
